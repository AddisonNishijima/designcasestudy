      <h1>The Overview</h1>
      <p>For our Design independent project we were challenged to make an app. Hen-Picked is a small business (run by my mother-in-law) specializing in fiber arts, that wished to have an online prescence. For my independent project I built a prototype for Hen-Picked, creating a potential online prescence for the business.

      <h1>Context and Challenge</h1>
      <p>
        As mentioned previously, Hen-Picked is a small business that specializes in fiber arts. The audience for this business is mostly found at the swaps that Hen-Picked vends at. They have very little audience outside of the swaps they vend at because they lack web media that can reach new potential customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The major challenge was to create an online prescence for Hen-Picked to attract more customers, and to inform their current customers.

        Goals:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>create a web design prototype for Hen-Picked</li>
        <li>web content must be easy to read for older audience members</li>
        <li>prototype must be easy to navigate</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <img src="img/logo.png">
      <p>
        For inspiration I looked to the finished logo itself as a jumping point. The logo art by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PyrokinesissArt/?fref=ts">Kathrine Lockett</a> features many wonderful colors and a playful nature.
      </p>
      <img src="img/palette.png">
      <p>
        Finding colors directly from the logo I developed a palette that I brought into the design during the medium fidelity mock-up. I also applied color theory to choose colors that are both aesthetically and emotionally appealing to the audience.

      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <p>
        For the overall prototype of this project it was important to create something that accomplished the goals above. Having text that was easy to read was accomplished by using simple, large fonts that had high contrast with the white background. Easy to use navigation was accomplished by creating a top navigation bar that is available on every page of this prototype. There is a footer featuring links to social media websites that is also on every page. Links to the craft pages are provided in the form of large icon buttons that feature the craft word and a picture of a tool relating to the craft so easy identification is possible. Overall the prototype accomplishes that goals that were set for this project and provides a very user-friendly experience.
      </p>
      <img src="img/header.jpg">
      <p>
        The completed header is something I am very proud of. Giving the logo a backboard to almost "pop" out from really makes the pageheaders more appealing and provides a contrast to the dark brown of the nav bar.
      </p>
      <img src="img/icons.png">
      <p>
        The icons I created which act as links to craft pages were made by looking at the fiber crafts and their tools, then debating which tool best represented the craft. Once a tool was selected, I created an icon featuring that tool to act as a symbol for whichever fiber craft page needed to be linked to.
